                        <p>
                            As a Software Engineer Intern, my main project during this summer was the Modeling Sim and Verification Tool Software Database. Prior to my internship, MSAVT was using an Excel spreadsheet which was not efficient and hard to share since it would always get lost. The Digital Systems Integration Lab has a server with their own CMDB (configuration management database) which hasn't been used in over 10 years. So my task was to bring this back into use and create a similar one for MSAVT.

                               My home washing machine always had issues and after each repairman's visit, it would break again soon enough. My parents were ready to through in the towel and purchase a new washer but I told them to let me take a chance with it. The machine threw many error codes and after deciphering them, I realized that the issue was the capacitors were swollen. So I went to fries and purchased 2 new ones for $10 and learned how to solder them back onto the motherboard. Like magic, the machine started to work again. Taking the risk of tinkering with the washer saved my parents at least $800.
