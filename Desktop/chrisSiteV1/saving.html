                        I started swimming when I was 7 years old and retired when I was 18 my senior year of high school. Sadly I stopped swimming a when freshmen year came around but I still enjoy jumping in once in a while.

                        I'm a pretty big "sneakerhead" or in layman terms: sneaker collector. I didn't have much money growing up so I started buying and selling sneakers so I could afford ones that I really wanted.

                        Lately I've been biking a lot. I have a canondale road bike that I like to take rides along the river bed and around Newport Beach during the school year.
